%% Neuropixels Trajectory Explorer
% Would like to make a version that works with the brainglobe atlases
% Why?
% Becvause it allows easier installation and updataing of atlases and has
% slightly better annotation than some of the existing one

%% How to do it?

% Would change almost all the code to work with atlas objects that would
% then be how the GUI accesses atlas data.
% Can define boundaries, resolution etc as well as all annotations and
% included information in standard properties

% Would also then like to add object based well 'objects' to cover the
% information for electrodes and then eventually optic fibres and other
% probes

% Would be nice if fibres then could estimate the projection of light
% also...

% Would also be nice if I made a matlab wrapper to interact with the python
% brainglobe-atlas api...
